I hope this letter finds you in a dimension that has, at the very minimum, twenty-four hours of uninterrupted electricity. We do not, as you may have surmised, have that here.

You spoke of industrialisation. You built the Akosombo Dam — a colossal monument to ambition and the optimism of a newly independent nation. Then Ghana got creative.

We created something called Dumsor — a portmanteau from Twi meaning "off-on." The lights go off. Then they come on. Then they go off again. Sometimes for hours.

We have adapted remarkably. Generators are standard fixtures. Power banks, candle sellers, generator fuel vendors — an entire ecosystem built around light-off has emerged.

We do not blame you, Osagyefo. You gave us the dam. What we did with the transmission lines afterwards is entirely our own achievement.

Yours faithfully, with a charged power bank,

You championed socialism. We laughed at it in the 1980s, then thirty years later accidentally rebuilt parts of it inside our mobile phones.

Mobile Money — MoMo — launched in 2009. It allows anyone with a phone to send, receive, and store money through agents at roadside kiosks, barbershops, and churches.

The redistribution is staggering. A market woman in Tamale can receive payment from her daughter in Accra within seconds. The unbanked were, within a decade, sending money like texts.

You tried to build state infrastructure. The market built its own through the air.

We found your socialism, Kwame. It was yellow, fit in a pocket, and was MTN-branded.

You declared: "Africa must unite." We listened. For decades, the diaspora lived the dream elsewhere — Boston, London, Toronto, Accra-in-spirit.

Then 2019 came. The year you would have turned 110. Ghana declared it the "Year of Return" — a homecoming for all those who'd left.

And we came. Millions. We came to Elmina and Gorée, to face the ghosts of our origins. We came to Accra, to taste our mother's cooking. We came to reclaim something we didn't know we'd lost.

For a moment, the diaspora became the home. The prodigals returned not as visitors, but as inheritors. Tourism became pilgrimage.

The Year of Return asked: what does it mean to belong? Not to a place, but to a people, a history, a reckoning?

The Cedi has weakened. Against the dollar, the pound, even the East African shilling — it shrinks like a sweater in hot water.

We have invited the IMF back. They arrive with briefcases and recommendations, speaking in the language of structural adjustments and fiscal discipline.

This is the arithmetic of modern Africa: borrow to grow, cut to survive, privatize to stabilize. It's mathematics written in the language of distant creditors.

You fought for dignity. We're fighting for solvency. It's not the same war, Kwame.

Yet here's the thing: we keep going. The market women still sell, the hawkers still hawk, the traders adapt. We are not our currency.

Every four years, we do this: we queue in the sun, we vote, we hope. Then promises dissolve like sugar in rain.

Politicians speak of growth and development. Of jobs that never arrive on schedule, of hospitals half-built, of roads that become rivers in season.

Yet we return. We queue again, four years later. Hope is a chronic disease here, and we never seem to find the cure.

You said democracy must come to Africa. She came. She wore a beautiful dress and made beautiful promises. We married her anyway, knowing she had a wandering eye.

Still, Kwame — she's ours. Imperfect, unreliable, occasionally bewildering. But ours.

You liberated a nation. We liberated rice from mediocrity.

Jollof is our national dish — or rather, it's the dish we wage national wars over. We claim ownership like territorial champions. "Ghanaian jollof is the best." "No, Nigerian jollof..." And so it goes.

It's rice, tomato, pepper. Simple. Yet somehow it represents everything: pride, identity, the small victories we take for ourselves.

You gave us the nation. We gave it flavour.

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority is where innovation goes to retire and bureaucracy goes to thrive.

To renew a license takes an odyssey. Forms must be gathered. Offices must be visited. Officers must be appeased. It's an expedition, not a transaction.

Obimanso: where the sun beats down with the fury of a scorned lover and progress seems a luxury imported from elsewhere.

The roads are rough. The water is scarce. The schools lack basic things and the clinics are pharmacies without the pharmacy.
